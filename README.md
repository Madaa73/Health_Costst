# Health_Costst
This project is part of a course focused on using machine learning to predict healthcare costs. The objective is to develop a model using linear regression to predict health expenses based on given data.

In this project, you are provided with a dataset containing personal information and corresponding healthcare costs. Your task is to use this data to train a model that can predict healthcare expenses for new data.
Key Steps:

    Data Preprocessing: You will import libraries and the dataset, converting categorical data into numerical values.
    Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets.
    Model Training: You will create and train a regression model using the training dataset.
    Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance on the test dataset. To pass the challenge, the model’s Mean Absolute Error (MAE) should be under $3500, meaning the model predicts healthcare costs within $3500 of the actual values.
    Results Visualization: The final cell will predict expenses using the test data and graph the predicted vs. actual results.

The project will be done using Google Colaboratory, and you must ensure your notebook passes the provided tests before submission.
Course Context:

This project is part of a broader machine learning course, and it helps students develop practical skills in regression analysis and real-world data prediction.
